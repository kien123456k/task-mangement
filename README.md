## [Live demo](https://youtu.be/8QvVxK2__P4) or [Try it here](https://task-management-r-n-151101.web.app)
**Note:** May take a few minutes to start the backend server due to Heroku need time to wake up

## What is Task Management?
- A web application that may save you from missing tasks. But this is still a simple one.
- I strongly recommend you to enhance this project if you want to use it on production or you can just refer this project.
- Preventing from abusing the demo server, I limited the number of user and task per user to 3 and 10 respectively.
- Below is 3 users account:

| Username |   Password   |
|:--------:|:------------:|
|  user1   |   Password1  | 
|  user2   |   Password2  |
|  user3   |   Password3  |

`The more full feature is comming soon!`

## Available Scripts
- To advoid the complexity of setup client and server, I strongly recommend you to setup with `Docker`
- If you want to run Book Playlist without `Docker` or run separately, read the `README.md` in `client` and `server` folder.
- In the project directory, you can run following commands to setup with `Docker`:

## Start up docker containers
```
yarn start
```

## Shutdown docker containers
```
yarn stop
```
